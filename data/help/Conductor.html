<h2 id="conductors">Conductors</h2>
<p>First, consult the help file for your device type to join the Network.</p>
<h3 id="getting-started">Getting started</h3>
<ul>
<li>Only one person should use the 'conductor' web interface at a time. (This refers only to this role in controlling the digital score and not a person holding a baton (of which you may ave any number or none). The person controlling the score can be any person on the network.)</li>
<li>Once logged in, the conductor should see a button on the top left of the screen.</li>
<li>Touch screen users should click this button. Others should put their mouse pointer over it.</li>
<li>A drop down menu should appear.</li>
<li>The conductor should click on the <code>Conductor</code> link</li>
<li>Some users will not see a drop down menu. Instead, they will see a button that has some text links by it or below it. It is possible to control the piece via a device with these limitations, but it is better to use a more capable device. This device can still be used to view the score.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="controlling-the-piece">Controlling the piece</h3>
<p>The conductor can control many parameters of the piece including total duration, the duration of each slide, and how long of a blank screen to leave at the start (so, for example, you would not project 'Ready' to an audience).</p>
<p>The conductor can also control the dimensions of the score. For an ensemble of mixed phone and tablet (or laptop) devices, <code>Portrait (3x4)</code> is probably best.</p>
<p>There is also an opportunity to pick colours. You may wish to experiment with a white foreground and a black background. Be careful not to set the foreground and the background to the same colour.</p>
<p>Press start to start the piece. You will be redirected to view the score. Not everyone will see updates at the same time.</p>
<p>If you wish to stop the score once it is running, select 'Stop' from the menu in the top left corner.</p>
<p>If you wish to Restart a score that has finished or is currently running, select 'Restart' from the menu in the top left corner.</p>
<h3 id="shutting-down">Shutting down</h3>
<p>After you are done and want to pack up, you need to properly shut down the computer. From the conductor page, select, <code>Shutdown Computer</code> and then click to shutdown on the next page. The following page should fail to load.</p>
<p>Please wait a minute before unplugging the computer.</p>
<p>You <em>must</em> shut down the computer properly before unplugging it.</p>
<h3 id="changing-or-removing-the-wifi-password">Changing or removing the WiFi Password</h3>
<p>Click <code>Change Wifi Password</code> to set a new wifi password. Leave the password fields blank if you want to leave the wifi passwordless.</p>
<p>Write your new passsword down. It may be a good idea to write it down on the Immrama computer, on a sticker or a post it note.</p>
<p>All users on the first page have access to <code>Show Wifi Password</code> and can use this to help others log on. Only the Conductor should change or set the password.</p>
