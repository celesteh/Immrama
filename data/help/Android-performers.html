<ul>
<li>Once logged in, users should see a button on the top left of their screen.</li>
<li>Touch screen users should click this button. Others should put their mouse pointer over it.</li>
<li>A drop down menu should appear.</li>
<li>Performers should click on the <code>Performers</code> link</li>
<li>Some users will not see a drop down menu. Instead, they will see a button that has some text links by it or below it. Those users should click the <code>Old Devices</code> link or try a different web browser.</li>
<li>All Performers should then see a screen which says <code>Ready</code></li>
<li>Performers should use their web browser to make a bookmark of this page.</li>
<li>Some performers will see a small button on the top left corner. They may click it to select <code>Full Screen</code></li>
<li>To keep their screen from turning off, those using touch screen can stroke the bottom of their screen gently throughout the piece.</li>
<li>Performers <em>should not</em> click the <code>Conductor</code> link. You are on the honor system.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>When the piece is running, not everyone will see updates at the same time. If you do not see updates at all:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Make sure you are on the right wifi network. If your device allows you to say which devices you prefer, put this one at the top of the list.</li>
<li>If your device keeps switching to another network (such as eduroam) and you can't get it to stop otherwise, tell it to forget the other network. In this case, you will need to forget the network before every performance or rehearsal of the piece. When you rejoin the 'forgotten' network later, you will need to have the password, etc as if you are a new user.</li>
<li>Check if you have javascript disabled. If so, enable it and reload the page.</li>
<li>If you still do not see updates, go back a page and select <code>Old Devices</code>. Be sure to update your bookmark.</li>
</ol>
