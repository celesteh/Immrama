<h2 id="preparing-your-smartphone-or-tablet">Preparing your smartphone or tablet</h2>
<p>Any device with a web browser can be used to view the score. Users who have smartphones are advised to take a few steps before performances or rehearsals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the device to silent</li>
<li>Disable receiving SMS and phone calls</li>
<li>Turn off mobile data</li>
<li>Ensure that WiFI is turned on</li>
<li>Set a long delay before the screen turns off</li>
<li>Consider disabling your device password</li>
<li>Ensure your device is fully charged</li>
<li>If you have an Android phone, the Chrome browser and the Firefox browser both work better than the app named ‘Browser’. Please install either of these browsers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="preparing-your-laptop-or-desktop-computer">Preparing your laptop or desktop computer</h2>
<ul>
<li>Disable your screen saver</li>
<li>Set your screen not to dim for at least the planned duration of the piece</li>
<li>If your device is connected to a projector, it is not necessary to mirror displays. You may open a web browser in a second projector screen and also have a web browser open in the screen in front of you.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="joining-the-network">Joining the network</h2>
<ul>
<li>Join the Immrama wifi network.</li>
<li>The wifi password is <code>12345678</code>
<ul>
<li>If this changes, write it down.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Smart phone users may see a prompt to log in via a web browser. Android users (and other non-iPhone users) should follow this prompt <em>if</em> they can log in with a fully-functional web browser.</li>
<li>iPhone users, users that cannot log in with a fully functional browser, and users that <em>do not</em> see a login should try connecting to one of the following URLs:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://immrama.local" class="uri">http://immrama.local</a></li>
<li><a href="http://immrama" class="uri">http://immrama</a></li>
<li><a href="http://immrama.home" class="uri">http://immrama.home</a></li>

</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="performers-or-display-devices">Performers (or display devices)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Once logged in, users should see a button on the top left of their screen.</li>
<li>Touch screen users should click this button. Others should put their mouse pointer over it.</li>
<li>A drop down menu should appear.</li>
<li>Performers should click on the <code>Performers</code> link</li>
<li>Some users will not see a drop down menu. Instead, they will see a button that has some text links by it or below it. Those users should click the <code>Old Devices</code> link</li>
<li>All Performers should then see a screen which says <code>Ready</code></li>
<li>Performers should use their web browser to make a bookmark of this page. iOS users should save the link to their desktop and use that link when they next join the piece</li>
<li>Some performers will see a small button on the top left corner. They may click it to select <code>Full Screen</code></li>
<li>To keep their screen from turning off, those using touch screen can stroke the bottom of their screen gently throughout the piece.</li>
<li>Performers <em>should not</em> click the <code>Conductor</code> link. You are on the honor system.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>When the piece is running, not everyone will see updates at the same time. If you do not see updates at all:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make sure you are on the right wifi network. If your device allows you to say which devices you prefer, put this one at the top of the list.</li>
<li>If your device keeps switching to another network (such as eduroam) and you can’t get it to stop otherwise, tell it to forget the other network. In this case, you will need to forget the network before every performance or rehearsal of the piece. When you rejoin the ‘forgotten’ network later, you will need to have the password, etc as if you are a new user.</li>
<li>Check if you have javascript disabled. If so, enable it and reload the page.</li>
<li>If you still do not see updates, go back a page and select <code>Old Devices</code>. Be sure to update your bookmark.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conductors">Conductors</h2>
<h3 id="getting-started">Getting started</h3>
<ul>
<li>Only one person should use the ‘conductor’ web interface at a time. (This refers only to this role in controlling the digital score and not a person holding a baton (of which you may ave any number or none). The person controlling the score can be any person on the network.)</li>
<li>Once logged in, the conductor should see a button on the top left of the screen.</li>
<li>Touch screen users should click this button. Others should put their mouse pointer over it.</li>
<li>A drop down menu should appear.</li>
<li>The conductor should click on the <code>Conductor</code> link</li>
<li>Some users will not see a drop down menu. Instead, they will see a button that has some text links by it or below it. It is possible to control the piece via a device with these limitations, but it is better to use a more capable device. This device can still be used to view the score.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="controlling-the-piece">Controlling the piece</h3>
<p>The conductor can control many parameters of the piece including total duration, the duration of each slide, and how long of a blank screen to leave at the start (so, for example, you would not project ‘Ready’ to an audience).</p>
<p>The conductor can also control the dimensions of the score. For an ensemble of mixed phone and tablet (or laptop) devices, <code>Portrait (3x4)</code> is probably best.</p>
<p>There is also an opportunity to pick colours. You may wish to experiment with a white foreground and a black background. Be careful not to set the foreground and the background to the same colour.</p>
<p>Press start to start the piece. You will be redirected to view the score. Not everyone will see updates at the same time.</p>
<p>There is no way to stop a score once it is running, however, you can restart the score.</p>
<h3 id="shutting-down">Shutting down</h3>
<p>After you are done and want to pack up, you need to properly shut down the computer. From the conductor page, select, <code>Shutdown Computer</code> and then click to shutdown on the next page. The following page should fail to load.</p>
<p>Please wait a minute before unplugging the computer.</p>
<p>You <em>must</em> shut down the computer properly before unplugging it.</p>
<h3 id="changing-or-removing-the-wifi-password">Changing or removing the WiFi Password</h3>
<p>Click <code>Change Wifi Password</code> to set a new wifi password. Leave the password fields blank if you want to leave the wifi passwordless.</p>
<p>Write your new passsword down. It may be a good idea to write it down on the Immrama computer, on a sticker or a post it note.</p>
<p>All users on the first page have access to <code>Show Wifi Password</code> and can use this to help others log on. Only the Conductor should change or set the password.</p>
