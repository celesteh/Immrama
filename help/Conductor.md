## Conductors

First, consult the help file for your device type to join
the Network.

### Getting started

* Only one person should use the 'conductor' web interface at a time. (This refers only to this role in controlling the digital score and not a person holding a baton (of which you may ave any number or none). The person controlling the score can be any person on the network.)
* Once logged in, the conductor should see a button on the top left of the screen.
* Touch screen users should click this button. Others should put their mouse pointer over it.
* A drop down menu should appear.
* The conductor should click on the `Conductor` link
* Some users will not see a drop down menu. Instead, they will see a button that has some text links
by it or below it. It is possible to control the piece via a device with these limitations, but
it is better to use a more capable device. This device can still be used to view the score.


### Controlling the piece

The conductor can control many parameters of the piece including total duration,
the duration of each slide, and how long of a blank screen to leave at the start (so,
for example, you would not project 'Ready' to an audience).

The conductor can also control the dimensions of the score. For an ensemble of mixed phone and tablet (or laptop) devices,
`Portrait (3x4)` is probably best.

There is also an opportunity to pick colours. You may wish to experiment with a white foreground
and a black background. Be careful not to set the foreground and the background to the same
colour.

Press start to start the piece. You will be redirected to view the score. Not everyone
will see updates at the same time.

If you wish to stop the score once it is running, select
'Stop' from the menu in the top left corner.

If you wish to Restart a score that has finished or is
currently running, select 'Restart' from the menu in
the top left corner.

### Shutting down

After you are done and want to pack up, you need to properly shut down the computer.
From the conductor page, select, `Shutdown Computer` and then click to shutdown
on the next page. The following page should fail to load.

Please wait a minute before unplugging the computer.

You _must_ shut down the computer properly before unplugging it.

### Changing or removing the WiFi Password

Click `Change Wifi Password` to set a new wifi password. Leave the password fields blank
if you want to leave the wifi passwordless.

Write your new passsword down. It may be a good idea to write it down on the Immrama computer, on a sticker or a post it note.

All users on the first page have access to `Show Wifi Password` and can use this to help
others log on. Only the Conductor should change or set the password.
