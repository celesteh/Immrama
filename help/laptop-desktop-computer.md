# Immrama - laptop and desktop devices

While some ensembles may choose for every performer to have their own
smart phone or tablet to view the piece, it is possible to also use
laptops (or iMacs, desktops, etc), either one one per performer, or placed within the sight of several
performers. Ensembles may also wish to project the score, either for their
performers, the audience or both.

## Preparing your laptop or desktop computer

* Disable your screen saver
* Set your screen not to dim for at least the planned duration of the piece
* If your device is connected to a projector, it is not necessary to mirror displays. You may open a web browser in a second projector screen and also have a web browser open in the screen in front of you.
* This piece has been tested with Firefox and Chrome and should also work with Safari and recent versions of Internet Explorer. If you have problems with the score not looking or functioning correctly, please download and use a recent version of Firefox.

## Joining the network

* Join the Immrama wifi network.
* The wifi password is `12345678`
    *   If this changes, write it down.
* Some computers may see a prompt to log in via a web browser. Follow this prompt _if_ you can open in it a fully-featured modern web browser.
* Users that cannot log in with a fully functional browser, and users that _do not_ see a login should try connecting to one of the following URLs:
    *   [http://immrama.local](http://immrama.local)
    *   [http://immrama](http://immrama)
    *   [http://immrama.home](http://immrama.home)
    *   [http://immrama.localnet](http://immrama.localnet)
    *   [http://172.24.1.1](http://172.24.1.1)
    *   [http://kent.ac.uk](http://kent.ac.uk)

## Performers (or display devices)

Follow these instructions for every browser window you intend to use to
display the notation:

1. Once logged in, users should see a button on the top left of their screen.

  ![Button](./menu.png)

2. Some users will see a button that has some text links
  by it or below it. Those users should click the `Old Devices` link and skip to step 8, or try a different web browser.

3. Touch screen users should click the button. Others should put their mouse pointer over it.
4. A drop down menu should appear.

5. If no menu opens, click on the `Old Devices` link near the bottom of the page and go to step 8, or try a different web browser.
7. Performers should click on the `Performers` link.
8. All Performers should then see a screen which says `Ready`.
7. Performers should use their web browser to make a bookmark of this page.
9. Some performers will see a small button on the top left corner. They may use it to select `Full Screen`.

10. Performers and Display Devices _should not_ click the `Conductor` link. You are on the honor system.

### Troubleshooting

When the piece is running, not everyone will see updates at the same time. If you do not see updates at all:

1. Make sure you are on the right wifi network. If your device allows you to say which devices you prefer,
put this one at the top of the list.
2. If your device keeps switching to another network (such as eduroam) and you can't get it to stop otherwise, tell it to forget the other network. In this case, you will need to forget the network before every performance or
rehearsal of the piece. When you rejoin the 'forgotten' network later, you will need to have the
password, etc as if you are a new user.
3. Check if you have javascript disabled. If so, enable it and reload the page.
4. If you still do not see updates, go back a page and select `Old Devices`. Be sure to update your bookmark.
